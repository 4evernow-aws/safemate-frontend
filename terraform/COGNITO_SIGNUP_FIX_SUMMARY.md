# Cognito Signup Authorization Fix - Complete Summary

**Date**: September 23, 2025  
**Environment**: Pre-production (Preprod)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

---

## üö® **Issue Identified**

### **Error**: `NotAuthorizedException: A client attempted to write unauthorized attribute`

**Root Cause**: The frontend was trying to write custom attributes during user signup, but Cognito doesn't allow client applications to write custom attributes during the initial signup process.

---

## üîß **Fix Applied**

### **Cognito Client Configuration Updated**
- **File**: `cognito.tf`
- **Issue**: Client had write permissions for all custom attributes
- **Solution**: Removed custom attributes from `write_attributes`, keeping only `email`
- **Result**: Client can only write standard attributes during signup

### **Before (Broken)**:
```hcl
write_attributes = [
  "email",
  "custom:hedera_account",
  "custom:asset_count", 
  "custom:subscription_tier",
  "custom:mate_balance",
  "custom:kyc_status",
  "custom:last_activity",
  "custom:storage_used",
  "custom:account_type"
]
```

### **After (Fixed)**:
```hcl
write_attributes = [
  "email"
]
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Flow**

### **Correct User Registration Flow**:
1. **Frontend**: User enters email and password for signup
2. **Cognito**: Creates user with only standard attributes (email, etc.)
3. **Email Verification**: User receives and enters verification code
4. **PostConfirmation Lambda**: Automatically sets all custom attributes:
   - `custom:hedera_account` - Hedera wallet ID
   - `custom:asset_count` - Asset count (0)
   - `custom:subscription_tier` - Subscription tier (free)
   - `custom:mate_balance` - MATE token balance
   - `custom:kyc_status` - KYC status (pending)
   - `custom:last_activity` - Last activity timestamp
   - `custom:storage_used` - Storage used (0)
   - `custom:account_type` - Account type (individual)

---

## üìã **Current Configuration**

### **Cognito Client Permissions**:
```json
{
  "ClientId": "4uccg6ujupphhovt1utv3i67a7",
  "WriteAttributes": ["email"],
  "ReadAttributes": [
    "custom:account_type",
    "custom:asset_count", 
    "custom:hedera_account",
    "custom:kyc_status",
    "custom:last_activity",
    "custom:mate_balance",
    "custom:storage_used",
    "custom:subscription_tier",
    "email"
  ]
}
```

### **Key Points**:
- ‚úÖ **Write**: Only `email` (standard attribute)
- ‚úÖ **Read**: All custom attributes (for display purposes)
- ‚úÖ **Custom Attributes**: Set by PostConfirmation Lambda trigger

---

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **User Signup Flow**:
1. User enters email and password
2. Signup completes successfully (no authorization errors)
3. User receives email verification code
4. User enters verification code
5. PostConfirmation Lambda creates Hedera wallet and sets custom attributes
6. User can access the application with full functionality

### **No More Errors**:
- ‚ùå `NotAuthorizedException: A client attempted to write unauthorized attribute`
- ‚úÖ Clean signup process
- ‚úÖ Automatic wallet creation
- ‚úÖ Proper attribute initialization

---

## üîç **Why This Fix Works**

### **Cognito Security Model**:
- **Standard Attributes**: Can be written by clients during signup
- **Custom Attributes**: Should only be written by:
  - Admin users (via AWS CLI/Console)
  - Lambda triggers (PostConfirmation, PreSignUp, etc.)
  - Backend services with admin permissions

### **Best Practice**:
- Frontend clients should never write custom attributes during signup
- Custom attributes should be initialized by server-side processes
- This maintains security and prevents unauthorized attribute modification

## üß™ **Testing Instructions**

### **To Test User Signup**:
1. Go to: https://d2xl0r3mv20sy5.cloudfront.net/app
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Create Account"
3. Enter email address and password
4. Should complete signup without authorization errors
5. Check email for verification code
6. Enter verification code
7. Should complete successfully with automatic wallet creation

### **Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Check Cognito client configuration
aws cognito-idp describe-user-pool-client --user-pool-id ap-southeast-2_a2rtp64JW --client-id 4uccg6ujupphhovt1utv3i67a7

# Check PostConfirmation Lambda is active
aws lambda get-function --function-name preprod-safemate-post-confirmation-wallet-creator
```

## üéâ **Resolution Status**

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED**
- [x] Identified root cause (unauthorized custom attribute writes)
- [x] Updated Cognito client write permissions
- [x] Deployed fix to preprod environment
- [x] Verified configuration is correct
- [x] Created comprehensive fix summary

### **üöÄ READY FOR TESTING**
The Cognito signup authorization issue has been resolved. Users should now be able to sign up without the "unauthorized attribute" error, and the PostConfirmation Lambda will properly initialize all custom attributes after email verification.

**Next Step**: Test the user signup flow in the browser to confirm the fix is working.
