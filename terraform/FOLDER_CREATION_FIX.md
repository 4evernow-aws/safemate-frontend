# Folder Creation Fix - Preprod Environment

## Issue Identified
**Problem**: Folder creation was successful (code returned "yes created") but folders were not showing up in the UI.

**Root Cause**: Data structure mismatch between Lambda function response and frontend expectations.

## Technical Details

### 1. Create Folder Response Mismatch
**Lambda Function** was returning:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  tokenId: "0.0.123456",
  folderName: "Holidays",
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Frontend** was expecting:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    folderId: "0.0.123456",  // Expected 'folderId', not 'tokenId'
    name: "Holidays",        // Expected 'name', not 'folderName'
    createdAt: "2025-09-24T...", // Expected 'createdAt'
    parentFolderId: null     // Expected 'parentFolderId'
  }
}
```

### 2. List Folders Response Mismatch
**Lambda Function** was returning:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    folders: [...]  // Nested structure
  }
}
```

**Frontend** was expecting:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: [...]  // Direct array, not nested
}
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated createFolder Function (lines 350-369)
- Added `folderId` field (frontend expects this)
- Added `name` field (frontend expects this)
- Added `createdAt` field (frontend expects this)
- Added `parentFolderId` field (frontend expects this)
- Kept backward compatibility with existing fields

### 2. Updated listUserFolders Function (lines 395-413)
- Changed response structure from nested to direct array
- Added proper field mapping:
  - `id` (from `tokenId`)
  - `name` (from `folderName`)
  - `files: []` (empty array as expected)
  - `subfolders: []` (empty array as expected)
- Added logging for debugging

### 3. Updated Terraform Configuration
- Updated Lambda function to use new deployment package
- Updated description to reflect fixes

## Files Modified
1. `services/hedera-service/index.js` - Fixed response formats
2. `lambda.tf` - Updated deployment package reference
3. Created new deployment package: `hedera-service-folder-fix.zip`

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Lambda function updated with new code
- ✅ Terraform configuration applied
- ✅ Old deployment packages cleaned up
- ✅ Ready for testing

## Testing Instructions
1. Try creating a folder named "Holidays" through the UI
2. The folder should now appear in the folder list immediately
3. Check browser console for successful creation and listing logs

## Environment
- **Environment**: preprod
- **Lambda Function**: preprod-safemate-hedera-service
- **Deployment Package**: hedera-service-folder-fix.zip
- **Date**: September 24, 2025

## Notes
- Folders are created as NFT tokens on Hedera testnet blockchain
- Metadata is stored on blockchain for maximum security
- DynamoDB only stores minimal reference information
- This fix ensures proper communication between backend and frontend
