# PostConfirmation Lambda Fix - Complete

## Problem Resolved
The PostConfirmation Lambda was failing with the error:
```
PostConfirmation failed with error Error: Cannot find module 'long' 
Require stack: - /opt/nodejs/node_modules/@hashgraph/sdk/lib/EntityIdHelper.cjs
```

## Root Cause
The `hedera-sdk-layer:1` Lambda layer was missing the `long` module dependency that the Hedera SDK requires.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed Lambda Layer**: Removed the `hedera-sdk-layer:1` from the PostConfirmation Lambda configuration
2. **Added Dependencies**: Updated `package.json` to include:
   - `@hashgraph/sdk: ^2.73.1`
   - `long: ^5.2.3`
3. **Created New Deployment Package**: 
   - Installed dependencies with `npm install --omit=dev`
   - Created deployment package: `post-confirmation-wallet-creator-final.zip` (58MB)
4. **Deployed via S3**: Used S3 upload method to deploy the large package:
   - Uploaded to: `s3://preprod-safemate-static-hosting/lambda-deployments/`
   - Updated Lambda function code via S3 reference

## Current Status
âœ… **PostConfirmation Lambda Updated Successfully**
- Function: `preprod-safemate-post-confirmation-wallet-creator`
- Code Size: 60,778,631 bytes (58MB)
- Dependencies: Complete Hedera SDK with all required modules
- Layer: None (all dependencies included in package)

## Next Steps
1. Test the Lambda function with a real user signup
2. Verify email verification process works end-to-end
3. Monitor Lambda logs for any remaining issues

## Files Modified
- `d:\safemate-infrastructure\services\post-confirmation-wallet-creator\package.json`
- `d:\safemate-infrastructure\services\post-confirmation-wallet-creator\post-confirmation-wallet-creator-final.zip`

## AWS Resources Updated
- Lambda Function: `preprod-safemate-post-confirmation-wallet-creator`
- S3 Object: `s3://preprod-safemate-static-hosting/lambda-deployments/post-confirmation-wallet-creator-final.zip`

The PostConfirmation Lambda should now be able to import the Hedera SDK and create wallets for new users without the "Cannot find module 'long'" error.
