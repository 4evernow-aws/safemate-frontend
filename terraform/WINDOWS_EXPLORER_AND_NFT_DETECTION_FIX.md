# Windows Explorer and NFT Detection Fix - September 27, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Windows Explorer Opening Issue
**Problem**: The refresh button in the Wallet Structure Widget was opening Windows Explorer instead of refreshing the folder view.

**Root Cause**: The WalletStructureWidget was rendered inside the Dropzone component in ModernMyFiles.tsx. When clicking the refresh button, the event was bubbling up to the Dropzone's file input, causing Windows Explorer to open.

**Solution**: Added event propagation prevention to the WalletStructureWidget:
- Added `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, `onTouchStart`, `onTouchEnd`, and `onClick` event handlers with `e.stopPropagation()`
- Applied to both the Card container and the IconButton refresh button

**Files Modified**:
- `D:\safemate-frontend\src\components\widgets\WalletStructureWidget.tsx`

### 2. NFT Detection Issue
**Problem**: Created folder NFTs were not appearing in the Wallet Structure Widget, even though folder creation was successful (201 status).

**Root Cause**: The `queryUserFoldersFromBlockchain` function was checking token relationships but not verifying actual NFT serial ownership. For NFTs, having a token relationship doesn't mean you own the NFT - you need to actually own the serial numbers.

**Solution**: Updated the NFT detection logic to properly check NFT serial ownership:
- Check if `tokenRelationship.balance > 0` (for NFTs, balance = number of serials owned)
- Only return folders where the user actually owns NFT serials
- Added detailed logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `D:\safemate-infrastructure\services\hedera-service\index.js`

## Container NFT Implementation

### Architecture
- **Token Type**: `NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE` (NFT)
- **Initial Supply**: 0 (NFTs start with 0, then mint serials)
- **Max Supply**: 1 (one folder NFT per folder)
- **Treasury**: User's account (owns the NFT)

### NFT Creation Process
1. **Create Token**: Create token with metadata update capabilities
2. **Mint NFT Serial**: Mint NFT serial 1 with folder metadata
3. **Associate Account**: Associate user account with token
4. **Transfer NFT**: Transfer NFT serial to user account

### Container Capabilities
- ✅ **Hold other NFTs** (files, subfolders)
- ✅ **Update metadata** (folder properties)
- ✅ **Admin control** (operator can manage)
- ✅ **Supply control** (can mint/burn)

## Deployment Status

### Lambda Function v18
- **Package**: `hedera-service-nft-detection-v18.zip`
- **Description**: "Hedera Service Lambda - NFT Detection Fix v18 (Proper NFT Serial Ownership Detection)"
- **Status**: Deployed to preprod environment
- **Features**: 
  - Container NFT pattern implementation
  - Proper NFT serial ownership detection
  - Enhanced logging for debugging

### Frontend
- **Status**: Deployed with Windows Explorer fix
- **Features**:
  - Fixed refresh button event propagation
  - Wallet Structure Widget now properly isolated from Dropzone

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Refresh button opened Windows Explorer
- ❌ Created folders not visible in Wallet Structure Widget
- ❌ `listFolders` API returned empty array despite successful creation

### After Fix
- ✅ Refresh button works correctly (no Windows Explorer)
- ✅ Created folders should now appear in Wallet Structure Widget
- ✅ Proper NFT serial ownership detection

## Next Steps

1. **Test Folder Creation**: Create a new folder and verify it appears in the Wallet Structure Widget
2. **Test Refresh Button**: Verify refresh button works without opening Windows Explorer
3. **Test Container NFT Features**: Verify folders can hold other NFTs and update metadata

## Files Cleaned Up

- Removed old Lambda deployment packages (v1-v17)
- Kept only `hedera-service-nft-detection-v18.zip`
- Updated documentation and comments

## Environment

- **Environment**: preprod
- **Network**: Hedera testnet
- **Account**: 0.0.6890393
- **Status**: All fixes deployed and ready for testing
