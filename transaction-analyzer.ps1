# Why folders might not be showing up
Write-Host "üö® Potential Issues with V47.13 Folder Listing:" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "   1. Treasury Token Detection Issue:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "      - V47.13 checks user's own treasury tokens first" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - If user is not treasury account for folder tokens, they won't be found" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Fallback to collection token 0.0.6920175 might not be working" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "   2. Token Association Issue:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "      - Folder token might not be properly associated with collection token" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Token might be associated but not with user as treasury account" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "   3. Mirror Node Query Issue:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "      - Query might be filtering out the folder tokens" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Token type filters might be incorrect" -ForegroundColor White

# Diagnostic steps
Write-Host "üîß Diagnostic Steps to Resolve:" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "   1. Check CloudWatch Logs:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "      - Look for 'Checking user treasury tokens...' messages" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Check if fallback to collection token 0.0.6920175 is executed" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Verify mirror node query results" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "   2. Verify Token Association:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "      - Check if folder token is associated with collection token 0.0.6920175" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Verify user account 0.0.6890393 is treasury account for folder token" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "   3. Test with Debug Endpoint:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "      - Add ?debug=1 to /folders endpoint" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Check what tokens are being scanned" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Verify query parameters and filters" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "   4. Manual Token Verification:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "      - Use Hedera Explorer to check transaction $transactionId" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Verify token creation and association details" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "      - Check token metadata and treasury account" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "   1. Check CloudWatch logs for the /folders API call" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   2. Verify transaction $transactionId in Hedera Explorer" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   3. Add debug endpoint to Lambda function" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   4. Test folder creation to verify token generation" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   5. Check if 'testfolder 01' token is properly associated" -ForegroundColor White
