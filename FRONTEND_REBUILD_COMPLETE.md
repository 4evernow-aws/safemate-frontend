## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **For You to Test:**

1. **Clear Browser Cache** (if not already done):
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
   - Select "All time"
   - Check "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Open Frontend**:
   - Navigate to `https://d2xl0r3mv20sy5.cloudfront.net/`
   - Wait for CloudFront to serve new files (may take 1-2 minutes)

3. **Sign In and Test**:
   - Sign in with your credentials
   - Try wallet operations
   - Check browser console for errors

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ **No "Failed to fetch" errors**
- ✅ **CORS preflight requests succeed**
- ✅ **Wallet operations work correctly**
- ✅ **API calls return proper responses**

---

## ⏳ **Important Notes**

### **CloudFront Cache**
- **Cache Invalidation**: Created but may take 1-2 minutes to complete
- **New Files**: Will be served once invalidation completes
- **Browser Cache**: May need to be cleared to see changes immediately

### **If Issues Persist**
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for CloudFront invalidation to complete
2. **Try incognito/private mode** to bypass browser cache
3. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors
4. **Verify API Gateway** is responding correctly

---
