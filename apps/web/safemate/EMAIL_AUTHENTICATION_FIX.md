# Email Authentication Fix - Preprod Environment

## Problem Summary

The email authentication was not working in the preprod environment after attempting to fix Hedera wallet creation. The issue was caused by a mismatch between the authentication libraries being used.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Library Mismatch Issue
- **Problem**: The application was using a mix of `amazon-cognito-identity-js` (legacy) and AWS Amplify Auth (modern)
- **Impact**: Email verification service was using legacy Cognito SDK while the rest of the app used Amplify Auth
- **Solution**: Migrated CognitoService to use AWS Amplify Auth consistently

### 2. Authentication Flow Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Different parts of the application were using different authentication methods
- **Impact**: Email verification failed because of incompatible authentication contexts
- **Solution**: Standardized all authentication to use AWS Amplify Auth

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CognitoService Migration
**File**: `src/cognito.ts`

**Changes**:
- Migrated from `amazon-cognito-identity-js` to AWS Amplify Auth
- Updated all methods to use Amplify Auth functions
- Added proper error handling and async/await patterns
- Added header comments documenting the migration

**Before**:
```typescript
import {
  CognitoUserPool,
  CognitoUser,
  CognitoUserAttribute,
  AuthenticationDetails,
  CognitoUserSession,
  type ISignUpResult
} from 'amazon-cognito-identity-js';
```

**After**:
```typescript
import { 
  signUp, 
  confirmSignUp, 
  signIn, 
  signOut, 
  getCurrentUser, 
  fetchAuthSession,
  resendSignUpCode
} from 'aws-amplify/auth';
```

### 2. Email Verification Service Enhancement
**File**: `src/services/emailVerificationService.ts`

**Changes**:
- Enhanced error handling for existing vs new users
- Added fallback logic for confirmed users
- Improved error messages and logging
- Added support for the new security requirement (email verification for all users)

**Key Improvements**:
- Handles both unconfirmed and confirmed users
- Provides better error messages
- Supports the new security requirement where all users need email verification

### 3. Authentication Flow Consistency
**Files**: `src/components/ModernLogin.tsx`, `src/contexts/UserContext.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Ensured all authentication flows use the same library
- Updated error handling to be consistent
- Fixed token generation and validation

### 4. Email Verification Error Handling Fix (2025-01-22)
**File**: `src/services/emailVerificationService.ts`

**Problem**: 
- Users getting "User cannot be confirmed. Current status is CONFIRMED" error
- Expired verification codes not handled properly
- Error messages not matching actual Cognito error responses

**Changes**:
- Added support for "User cannot be confirmed" and "Current status is CONFIRMED" error messages
- Added proper handling for `ExpiredCodeException`
- Enhanced error message matching for better user experience
- Updated header comments to reflect the fix

**Before**:
```typescript
if (confirmError.message.includes('User is already confirmed') ||
    confirmError.message.includes('already confirmed')) {
```

**After**:
```typescript
if (confirmError.message.includes('User is already confirmed') ||
    confirmError.message.includes('already confirmed') ||
    confirmError.message.includes('User cannot be confirmed') ||
    confirmError.message.includes('Current status is CONFIRMED')) {
```

## Technical Details

### Authentication Library Migration

**Old Implementation (Legacy)**:
```typescript
static signIn(email: string, password: string): Promise<CognitoUserSession> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const authenticationDetails = new AuthenticationDetails({
      Username: email,
      Password: password,
    });
    // ... legacy implementation
  });
}
```

**New Implementation (Amplify Auth)**:
```typescript
static async signIn(email: string, password: string): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const result = await signIn({
      username: email,
      password: password,
    });
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Email Verification Flow

**Enhanced Flow**:
1. User attempts to sign in
2. System validates credentials
3. System sends verification code (for all users)
4. User enters verification code
5. System verifies code and completes authentication
6. User proceeds to dashboard

**Error Handling**:
- Handles unconfirmed users (new signups)
- Handles confirmed users (existing users)
- Provides appropriate error messages
- Supports the new security requirement

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Email verification: Library mismatch errors
- ❌ Authentication: Inconsistent authentication contexts
- ❌ User experience: Confusing error messages
- ❌ Security: No email verification for existing users

### After Fix
- ✅ Email verification: Consistent Amplify Auth implementation
- ✅ Authentication: Unified authentication flow
- ✅ User experience: Clear error messages and flow
- ✅ Security: Email verification for all users

## Deployment Status

### Completed
- [x] CognitoService migrated to AWS Amplify Auth
- [x] Email verification service enhanced
- [x] Authentication flow standardized
- [x] Error handling improved
- [x] Code changes committed to preprod branch
- [x] Frontend built and deployed
- [x] Fixed error handling for already confirmed users
- [x] Added support for expired verification codes
- [x] CloudFront cache invalidated for latest changes

### Pending
- [ ] End-to-end testing of email authentication
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## Environment Configuration

### Preprod Environment Variables
```
VITE_COGNITO_REGION=ap-southeast-2
VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=ap-southeast-2_pMo5BXFiM
VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=1a0trpjfgv54odl9csqlcbkuii
VITE_COGNITO_DOMAIN=preprod-safemate-auth-wmacwrsy

### Cognito User Pool Status
- **User Pool ID**: `ap-southeast-2_pMo5BXFiM`
- **Auto Verified Attributes**: `email` ✅
- **Email Verification**: Enabled ✅
- **Status**: Configured and ready for testing

## Next Steps

1. **Test Email Authentication Flow**
   - Test new user registration with email verification
   - Test existing user sign-in with email verification
   - Verify error handling for various scenarios

2. **Monitor for Issues**
   - Check browser console for authentication errors
   - Verify email delivery and verification codes
   - Monitor user experience with new flow

3. **User Communication**
   - Inform users about the enhanced security
   - Provide clear instructions for verification process
   - Update help documentation

## Troubleshooting

### If Email Verification Still Fails
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify Cognito user pool configuration
3. Check if user account exists and is properly configured
4. Verify API endpoints are accessible

### If Authentication Errors Occur
1. Check if AWS Amplify Auth is properly configured
2. Verify environment variables are correct
3. Check network connectivity to AWS services
4. Review CloudWatch logs for Lambda functions

## Files Modified

1. `src/cognito.ts` - Migrated to AWS Amplify Auth
