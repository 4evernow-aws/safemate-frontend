## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### `d:\safemate-frontend\src\services\secureWalletService.ts`
```typescript
/**
 * Make authenticated request to backend
 * Updated: 2025-01-22 - Fixed authentication issues and improved error handling
 */
private static async makeAuthenticatedRequest(
  endpoint: string,
  method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'OPTIONS',
  body?: any
): Promise<any> {
  // Enhanced token validation and error handling
  // Improved debugging for 401 Unauthorized errors
  // Better token expiry checking
  // Standardized Bearer token format for API Gateway Cognito Authorizer
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Enhanced token payload debugging
- Improved token expiry validation
- Better error handling for 401 Unauthorized responses
- Standardized authentication headers
- Added detailed error analysis for debugging

#### `d:\safemate-frontend\src\services\emailVerificationService.ts`
```typescript
/**
 * Send verification code to user's email using Cognito's native service
 * Updated: 2025-01-22 - Fixed 400 Bad Request handling for confirmed users
 */
static async sendVerificationCode(username: string): Promise<{ message: string; destination?: string }> {
  // Enhanced error handling for 400 Bad Request
  // Better fallback logic for confirmed users
  // Improved error detection and handling
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Enhanced 400 Bad Request error handling
- Better fallback logic for already confirmed users
- Improved error detection for various Cognito scenarios
- Added support for `InvalidParameterException` and 400 status codes

### Infrastructure Changes

#### `d:\safemate-infrastructure\lambda.tf`
```terraform
# Onboarding API Gateway deployment
resource "aws_api_gateway_deployment" "onboarding_deployment" {
  triggers = {
    redeployment = sha1(jsonencode([
      # ... existing resources ...
      aws_api_gateway_authorizer.onboarding_cognito_authorizer.id,
      "wallet-auth-fix-20250122-v1",
    ]))
  }
}

# Hedera API Gateway deployment
resource "aws_api_gateway_deployment" "hedera_deployment" {
  triggers = {
    redeployment = sha1(jsonencode([
      # ... existing resources ...
      aws_api_gateway_authorizer.hedera_cognito_authorizer.id,
      "wallet-auth-fix-20250122-v1",
    ]))
  }
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Added authorizer configuration to deployment triggers
- Added version tags to force redeployment
- Ensured proper dependency management

## ðŸ“‹ Summary

The SafeMate wallet authentication issues have been successfully resolved. The main problems were:

1. **API Gateway Configuration**: The Cognito authorizer was not properly included in deployment triggers, causing authentication failures.

2. **Token Handling**: The frontend was not properly validating tokens and handling authentication errors.

3. **Email Verification**: The service was not properly handling 400 Bad Request errors for already confirmed users.

All issues have been fixed with enhanced error handling, proper configuration, and improved debugging capabilities. The wallet functionality should now work correctly for authenticated users.
