# SafeMate Wallet Issue Resolution - September 23, 2025

**Environment**: preprod  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üö® **Issue Identified**

The wallet functionality was failing with `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors when trying to access API endpoints. The frontend was attempting to call:

```
https://ol212feqdl.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/preprod/onboarding/status
```

This API Gateway ID (`ol212feqdl`) was from the old Edge-optimized API that was removed during the API Gateway cleanup.

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Frontend Environment Configuration**: The frontend environment files had been updated with correct Regional API Gateway URLs
2. **Build Cache Issue**: The frontend build was still using the old compiled version with incorrect API endpoints
3. **API Gateway Cleanup**: The old Edge-optimized APIs were removed, but the frontend wasn't rebuilt with the new URLs

## ‚úÖ **Resolution Applied**

### **1. Updated Frontend Environment Files**
Updated all environment files with correct Regional API Gateway URLs:

**Before (Incorrect)**:
```
VITE_ONBOARDING_API_URL=https://ol212feqdl.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/preprod
```

**After (Correct)**:
```
VITE_ONBOARDING_API_URL=https://ylpabkmc68.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/preprod
```

### **2. Rebuilt Frontend**
- Built frontend with `npm run build:preprod`
- Generated new compiled assets with correct API endpoints
- Verified build completed successfully

### **3. Deployed Updated Frontend**
- Synced new build to S3: `aws s3 sync dist/ s3://preprod-safemate-static-hosting --delete`
- Invalidated CloudFront cache: `aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E2AHA6GLI806XF --paths "/*"`

## üìä **Current API Gateway Configuration**

**‚úÖ Regional APIs (Active)**:
- **Onboarding API**: `https://ylpabkmc68.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/preprod`
- **Hedera API**: `https://uvk4xxwjyg.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/preprod`
- **Group API**: `https://o529nxt704.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/preprod`
- **Vault API**: `https://peh5vc8yj3.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/preprod`
- **Wallet API**: `https://ibgw4y7o4k.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/preprod`

**‚ùå Edge-optimized APIs (Removed)**:
- All old Edge-optimized APIs have been cleaned up

## üéØ **Expected Results**

With the frontend now using the correct API endpoints, the wallet functionality should work properly:

1. **User Authentication**: ‚úÖ Working (email verification successful)
2. **Wallet Status Check**: Should now work with correct onboarding API
3. **Wallet Creation**: Should now work with correct onboarding API
4. **PostConfirmation Lambda**: ‚úÖ Working (creates wallets after email verification)

## üîÑ **Wallet Flow Status**

```
User Registration ‚Üí Email Verification ‚Üí PostConfirmation Lambda ‚Üí Hedera Wallet Created ‚Üí Frontend Wallet Operations
```

- ‚úÖ **User Registration**: Working
- ‚úÖ **Email Verification**: Working  
- ‚úÖ **PostConfirmation Lambda**: Working (creates wallets)
- üîß **Frontend Wallet Operations**: Should now work with correct API endpoints

## üìã **Next Steps**

1. **Test Wallet Creation**: Try creating a wallet through the frontend
2. **Verify API Responses**: Check that API endpoints return proper responses
3. **Test Wallet Operations**: Test balance queries, transactions, etc.
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check CloudWatch logs for any remaining issues

## üöÄ **Deployment Status**

- ‚úÖ **Frontend Environment**: Updated with correct API URLs
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Build**: Rebuilt with correct configuration
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Deployment**: Deployed to S3 and CloudFront
- ‚úÖ **Cache Invalidation**: CloudFront cache cleared

The wallet functionality should now be fully operational with the correct API Gateway endpoints.
